### About Me
Hello! My name is Gavin Zhang. I am a second-year PhD student in the [ECE department](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. My advisor is [Richard Y. Zhang](https://ryz.ece.illinois.edu/). I am also a member of the [coordinated science laboratory](https://csl.illinois.edu/) at UIUC.

I'm mainly interested using optimization and machine learning to solve large-scale, data-driven problems with provable guarantees.  Previously I also have worked in other areas of applied and computational mathematics, such as numerical PDEs and mathematical biology.


I received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/), where I worked with professors [Chiu-Yen Kao](https://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/CKao/) and [Andrew Bernoff](http://www.math.hmc.edu/~ajb/) on numerical PDEs and mathematical biology. I also received a master's degree in computational mathematics from [Stanford](https://icme.stanford.edu/), where I worked with [Mert Pilanci](https://stanford.edu/~pilanci/).

<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Gavin Zhang. I am a second-year PhD student in the <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/">ECE department</a> at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. My advisor is <a href="https://ryz.ece.illinois.edu/">Richard Y. Zhang</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://csl.illinois.edu/">coordinated science laboratory</a> at UIUC.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m mainly interested using optimization and machine learning to solve large-scale, data-driven problems with provable guarantees.  Previously I also have worked in other areas of applied and computational mathematics, such as numerical PDEs and mathematical biology.</p>

<p>I received a bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a>, where I worked with professors <a href="https://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/CKao/">Chiu-Yen Kao</a> and <a href="http://www.math.hmc.edu/~ajb/">Andrew Bernoff</a> on numerical PDEs and mathematical biology. I also received a masterâ€™s degree in computational mathematics from <a href="https://icme.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://stanford.edu/~pilanci/">Mert Pilanci</a>.</p>
